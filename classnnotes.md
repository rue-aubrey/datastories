# Class Notes from Data Stories, 2022

## 11/3 Visual Communication and the Brain

### Pre-Attentive Attributes
- **Shape**: be precise, don't make people learn new shapes too often
- **Color**: sequential, diverging, categorical, highlight, alert
  - **Components**: hue, saturation, brightness
  - **Continuous** **gradients** versus **contrasting categories**
  - Darker colors represent more of something on white backgrounds
  - Lighter colors represent more of something on a black background
  - **Diverging** color schemes highlight LOWS and HIGHS, typically go outwards towards higher saturations
- **Texture**: an extra dimension of distinction to show relation besides color
- **Size**:  good for attention, but not great for precise quantitative comparison
-  - Bubble charts should often include quantification, size gives attention, but not quantity
-  **Position**: and alignment can call attention to small differences
-  **Grouping**: use highlighting (color) to emphasize natural groups of data
-  **Order**: can identify smallest and largest and easy relative
-  **Images**: familiar objects, people, faces call attention and add pathos


The way information is organized on a page matters! Eyes follow a predictable path.

### Werid Brain Effects

**Moir√© Effect**- If lines or patterns are too narrow, it can create an unpleasant shimmering effect and the pattern can overwhelm the information
  - Can occur with narrow grid lies or dense bar charts

**Harmann Effect** (the scintillating grid)
  - gray dots in small spaces that distract from the information
  - removing gaps between the squares can make information clearer


## Crafting for Clarity
- Take stuff away
- Remove redundancy
- Limit color and eye travel
- Know how people hitnk
- Describe ideas, not structure
- Align Everything
