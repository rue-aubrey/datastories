# Part III: Final Deliverable

## [Guns Won't Cure Our Fears](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/guns-wont-cure-our-fears/index.html)
A data story developed using [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/)

### The Development Process
***In Part I***, I began with a dataset and a vague idea of the story I could tell with it. I wanted to focus on gun purchases in resposne to major events. Thinking about my own experience, I remembered my father who decided to buy multiple guns for the family in response to his candidate losing a presidential election. Anecdotally, I was onto something. 

What I envisioned for telling my story was pictograms, a heatmap, and line charts with annotations of major events.

<br>
***In Part II***, I started making drafts of these visualizations with my data, both for feedback and to investigate if my predicted trends were true. What was suprising was the deadliest shooting in U.S. history, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, didn't see an unexpected increase in gun sales. 

I decided to look deeper into the story. In studies, I found that cultural anxiety is one of the largest indicators of whether someone will buy a gun. It's a sociopolitical phenomenon that extends beyond just a fear of violence.

The major sociopolitical events I decided to focus on were Obama's 2008 Election, the COVID-19 Shutdown, and the 2020 BLM Protests. Each of these corresponded to peaks in the data.

I tried using a line chart, but the seasonal noise was too much to show what I was looking for. Instead, I tried wrapping each year around a radar chart. The event-related peaks showed up in stark relief. After some edits to ensure legibility with lay audiences, I moved on to making the Shorthand and writing my narrative.

<br>
***In Part III***, I tried to incorporate Part II feedback and cite more sources to support my story. One of my interviewees suggested I make a map to prove my claim that gun sales spiked more in Republican-leaning states after Obama's election. Unfortunately, I couldn't make this happen. The data manipulation to calculate "Deviation from Expectation" for each state was too time-intensive.

However, I did have time to incorporate the suggested line charts to more clearly show decade-scale trends. I made one with a monthly resolution to demonstrate what I found with the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, and I made another with a yearly resolution to highlight 2020's massive surge in purchases.

<br>
***My Audience*** became clear as I received and incorporated feedback. Many people assume that mass shootings are the biggest drivers of gun sales. But studies and this dataset show a much stronger correlation to cultural anxieties, sociopolitical uncertainty, and distrust.

My audience, then, became socially concerned citizens with certain preconceptions about guns and why Americans buy them. I want to use this new perspective to propose *community and social trust* as the solution to the escalating arming of Americans.

<br>
***Calling to action*** was important, keeping people motivated by newfound perspective. I highlighted further reading and encouraged people to contribute to two different iniatives, one for mending community relationships and another for restoring social trust.
