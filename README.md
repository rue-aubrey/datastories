# About Me
Hi, I'm Rue Sellers _(she/her)_. I'm a 23 year old Masters student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I'm passionate about centering our policy frames on our local communities, prioritizing the needs of those who need most. 

I'm currently working as a student researcher with Daniel Nagin, studying algorithmic bias in the criminal legal system. Off campus, I run marketing for a Pittsburgh mutual aid organization and collaborate with Pittsburgh's art scene. 

My passion is writing and my expertise is data. Once graduated, I will continue to work at their intersection!

# What I hope to learn
I've done visualizations before when doing scientific research, but the graphics used in that field are typically hard to follow. They're often dense and technical. From this course, I hope to learn visual communication as a more versatile skill that I can apply in many contexts.
