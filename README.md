# About Me
Hi, I'm Rue Taylor _(she/her)_. I'm a 23 year old Masters student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I'm passionate about centering our policy frames on our local communities, prioritizing the needs of those who need most. 

I'm currently working as a student researcher with Daniel Nagin, studying algorithmic bias in the criminal legal system. Off campus, I run marketing for a Pittsburgh mutual aid organization and collaborate with Pittsburgh's art scene. 

My passion is writing and my expertise is data. Once graduated, I will continue to work at their intersection!
