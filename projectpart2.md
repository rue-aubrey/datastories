# Part II: Drafts and Feedback

With this data story, I'm trying to show how gun sales change in response to large political events like elections. I want to convey to my audience that Americans buy these guns as a reaction to fear. This fear comes from many places: fear of gun laws, fear of political change, fear of the other, and fear of death. 

One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369030/) from Callcut et al (2020) shows that mass shootings and gun laws have ramped up gun purchases to levels not seen before, particularly in the last 10 years.  One other [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0735648X.2021.1997787?journalCode=rjcj20) suggests that fear over **"loss of status"** is a much greater motivator of gun purchases than "lack of safety."

To tell this story, I want to incorporate stories of my dad, a conservative Evangelical Virginian. This personal anecdote exemplifies the larger sentiment shown in the data. It gives a face to reactionary factions their increasingly armed response to political change and polarization. What follows are the first two paragraphs of this narrative which introduce the story.

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:4em;"> It was the Christmas after Obama's historic victory in 2008. I was nine years old. My Virginian father, a staunch conservative and persistent Evangelical, bought his first gun. And his second. And third.

Obama is going to take away our freedom. We have to be able to protect our house. This is the end of America. These memories I have of my father were full of fear â€“ fear that taught me guns keeps us safe. Fear that just so happens to benefit gun manufacturers.</span>


## 1. Which kind of visualization should I use?
e  There's lots of ways I could do this. I thought about pictogram charts to show the sheer quantity of guns.
