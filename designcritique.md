## Final Visualization



## [Original  Visualization](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/spi_family_separation_sex.html)
from the Prison Policy Initiative, based on 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey of Prison Inmates

## Critique 
The first stage of used the technique from [Good Charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJC62tJaYt402543EbG_gNnxd9ZIaAl2qgJeVa-J-0Q/edit?usp=sharing). The second stage used the [Data Visualiztion Effectiveness Profile](https://github.com/ruesellers/datastories/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20Effectiveness%20Profile.pdf). The profile results were sent to me over email where the formatting got scrambled.

My major concern for this visualization is that subsequent Y variable is a subset of the previous, but there is little indication of this data relationship. I will use the relationship to separate the data into four categories of parental relationship to the child at the time of arrest, which add up to 100% of inmates surveyed who were parents.
1. Sole Caregiver
2. Partial Caregiver
3. Not a Caregiver
4. Children are not Minors
