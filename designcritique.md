# Critique by Design Project

## Final Visualization



## Original  Visualization
The [visualization](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/spi_family_separation_sex.html) is found on the Prison Policy Initiative website and was made by Wendy Sawyer in 2022. It's based on data from the 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey of Prison Inmates analyzed by the Prison Policy Initiative.

## Critique 
The first stage of critique used the technique from [Good Charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJC62tJaYt402543EbG_gNnxd9ZIaAl2qgJeVa-J-0Q/edit?usp=sharing). The second stage used the [Data Visualiztion Effectiveness Profile](https://github.com/ruesellers/datastories/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20Effectiveness%20Profile.pdf).

My major concern for this visualization is that subsequent Y variable is a subset of the previous, but there is little indication of this data relationship. I will use the relationship to separate the data into four categories of parental relationship to the child at the time of arrest, which add up to 100% of inmates surveyed who were parents.
1. Sole Caregiver
2. Partial Caregiver
3. Not a Caregiver
4. Children are not Minors

Equations for this data disaggregation can be found in the Excel file [here](https://github.com/ruesellers/datastories/raw/main/DATAFORDESIGNCRITIQUE.xlsx).

## Feedback on First Sketch
Sandhya reviewed my first sketch. They were able to understand the topic of the visualization and understand the nature of the percentages (numerator and denominator). Their main takeaway was that "of women arrested, more are sole caregivers, and more have kids who are still minors."

Their confusion came from two parts. First, "Partial Caregiver," where there is another caregiver in the household besides the arrested parent, was unclear to them. Second, they were concerned as to why women had such a higher percentage of minor children compared to men. They also want to know more about how many men and women there are in the data total. I do not have access to this data.

*These questions indicate that they find the visualization coherent and engaging enough to want to learn more.*

## First Draft
For this draft, I focused on transferring the sketch to a Flourish chart. As such, it's a bit of a rough draft. I clarified some of the labels, but at this point in the design process, I didn't know how to clarify "Partial Caregiver." I eventually figured this out in the Revised Draft.
