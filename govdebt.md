## The Visualizations
You can technically gather the first point, that the UK has the 5th highest debt in 2021, from all three visualizations. However, it is most clear how the UK stands globally in the bar graph. 

The second visuaization, the sparklines visualization, uniquely allows the reader to see how debt changed after COVID-19 for every country in the dataset. It is possible to compare across countries, but it isn't as easy as with a bar chart.

The final visualization, the map, allows us to see geographic trends and associations across Europe. It's much easier to see that Western Europe has higher debt than the rest of Europe.
